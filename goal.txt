Project Goal:
Write a python wrapper for creating command block arrays in minecraft.

Basic Blocks - Command Blocks and Data Blocks

Block Compounds - Command Block Arrays and Memory Slots
 - Contains the blocks which are part of the compound.

Block Space - Logical representation of blocks in the world
 - Receives a group of Block Compounds.
 - Goes over all Compounds and assigns them coordinates in the blockspace.

Translator - Takes logical representations and converts them to Minecraft Blocks and TileEntities
 - Goes over every Command Block in the blockspace and calls the command function.
 - Takes a block space and converts every pythonic object into a TileEntity and Minecraft Block.

Builder - Takes Minecraft Blocks and TileEntities and places them into the world.
 - Takes Minecraft Blocks and TileEntities and places them into the world based on their supplied positions.
