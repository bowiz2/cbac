# CABC - Command Block Array Circuit
## Python Library for writing command block circuits in minecraft.

Forget about manually building and configuring your command blocks.
With this library, you just describe your commands, and we will do  the rest.
Tiered of remembering the syntax of minecraft commands? No more! each command can be implemented as a fully
documented python function.



## Implemented Features for the circuit developer

**Command Block Arrays** - Write all your commands in python and import them as a schematic file.
**Registers** - An easy way of storing binary information, And interacting with it using commands.
**Units** - Implement complex logic on a higher abstraction level then a command block array.
